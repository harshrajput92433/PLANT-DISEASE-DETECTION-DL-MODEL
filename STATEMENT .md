# **Project Statement – Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning**

## **Problem Statement**

Agriculture is highly dependent on plant health, and diseases can spread quickly, reducing crop yield and causing major economic losses. Traditional disease detection relies on manual inspection by experts, which is time-consuming, subjective, and not easily accessible to farmers in remote areas. There is a need for an automated, reliable, and fast method for identifying plant diseases from leaf images to enable early treatment and prevent widespread damage.

## **Scope of the Project**

This project focuses on designing and developing an AI-based model capable of identifying plant leaf diseases using image classification. The system will analyze photos of plant leaves and determine whether the plant is healthy or infected, along with the predicted disease type. The scope includes data collection, preprocessing, deep learning model training, evaluation, and testing using real and benchmark images. Deployment models (mobile/web) and automated treatment suggestions are considered as future enhancements.

## **Target Users**

* Farmers seeking quick disease diagnosis in the field using mobile devices
* Agricultural researchers studying crop health and disease patterns
* Agricultural extension workers and government agencies monitoring large-scale crop conditions
* Students and developers exploring AI-based smart agriculture solutions

## **High-Level Features**

* Image-based plant disease classification with high accuracy
* Real-time prediction using camera or uploaded images
* Support for multiple plant species and disease categories
* Explainable AI using Grad-CAM to show affected leaf regions
* Lightweight deployment options suitable for smartphones and edge devices
* Ability to evaluate and test performance using visual metrics and confusion matrix
